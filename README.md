# BeeCTF
Laravel-Based Community CTF Platform

## Introduction
BeeCTF is a CTF platform intended for small and local community groups who want to host their own CTF competitions. A small size and light weight makes BeeCTF a good platform to be hosted even in a small computer such as Raspberry Pi effectively. Built on Laravel 5.8, BeeCTF is easy to install and run even if your hardware is more limited.
